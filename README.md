Benchmarking Open Source ML Frameworks (TF, Theano, MXNet, &amp; Caffe). Also Matlab Interface for Entry-Level Engineers on ML Framework

This paper covers a brief comparative study on four frameworksâ€”
Tensorflow, Theano, MXNet, and Caffe on several aspects: speed, utilization, and scalability
onto commercial platforms. Tensorflow achieved the overall best score and was utilized for
the language of choice for an interface between entry level engineers and an open source
framework.

The aim of this paper and likewise product, is to devise an interface that allows for
problems to be devised in Matlab and then properly ported over to Tensorflow to utilize the
extensive benefits this open-source tool provides for either GPU/CPU based hardware
configuration.
